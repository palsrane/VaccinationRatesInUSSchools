"This repository contains immunization rate data for schools across the U.S., as compiled by [The Wall Street Journal](https://github.com/WSJ/measles-data). The dataset includes the overall and MMR-specific vaccination rates for 46,412 schools in 32 states. As used in ["What's the Measles Vaccination Rate at Your Child's School?"](https://www.wsj.com/graphics/school-measles-rate-map/).  
  
Vaccination rates are for the 2017-18 school year for Colorado, Connecticut, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Utah and Washington. Rates for other states are 2018-19."

## 1. Data Cleanup :<a class="anchor"  id="chapter1"></a>  
  
#### Following code adds latitude and longitude to the dataset.
The initial cleaning code from [tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-02-25/readme.md) had to be modified because :    
  
 * It was resulting in an error, possibly because the page where [the list of URLs for individual states](https://github.com/WSJ/measles-data/tree/master/individual-states) was coming from has changed since the code was published.  

 * When we were adding the latitude and longitude data from the states to the original vaccination file, it was being done only with school name and if one state had multiple schools with the same name, that was leading to a many to many matching, resulting in a cartesian matching and duplication.)  
   
### 1.1 Additing geolocation <a class="anchor"  id="section_1_1"></a>  
  
```` {r}
# url_wsj <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WSJ/measles-data/master/all-measles-rates.csv"
# 
# wsj <- read_csv(url_wsj)
# 
# list_of_urls <- "https://github.com/WSJ/measles-data/tree/master/individual-states"
# 
# raw_states <- list_of_urls %>% 
#   read_html() %>% 
#   html_table() %>% 
#   .[[1]] %>% 
#   select(1) %>%  #changed select(Name) to select(1) becase there were three columns with headers 'Name'
#   mutate(Name = str_remove(Name, "\\.csv")) %>% 
#   filter(str_length(Name) > 3, str_length(Name) < 20) %>% 
#   pull(Name)
# 
# raw_states=raw_states[2:32] # had to add this line of code because the first element on the list was "parent directory.."  and the last, 33rd element was "View all files"
# 
# all_states <- glue::glue("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WSJ/measles-data/master/individual-states/{raw_states}.csv") %>% 
#   map(read_csv)
````
As it turns out, not every state had city, county, and district information included in the individual datasets. Hence in the original code was matching based on just the name of the school and state. This was leading to cross matching in states where multiple schools with same name were present
````{r}
##Do not use this code, use the next block with updated version
## clean_states <- all_states %>%
##   map(~select(., state, name, lat, lng)) %>%  
##   map(~mutate_at(., vars(lat, lng), as.numeric)) %>%
##   bind_rows() %>%
##   filter(!is.na(lat))
````

Hence added as many parameters that could have been added out of "state", "name", "district", "county", "city" for each state

````{r}
# clean_states <- all_states %>%
#   map(~select(., tidyselect::any_of(c("state", "name", "district", "county", "city", "lat","lng")))) %>%
#   map(~mutate_at(., vars(lat, lng), as.numeric)) %>%
#   bind_rows() %>%
#   filter(!is.na(lat))
# 
# wsj1 <- wsj %>% 
#   left_join(clean_states, by = c("name", "state","district", "county", "city"))
````
Creating a new identifier to remove duplications  
````{r}
#wsj1=mutate(wsj1,new_id=paste0(state,year,name,type,city,county,district,enroll,mmr,overall,xrel,xmed,xper)) 
#wsj1=wsj1[!duplicated(wsj1$new_id),]
````
You can save the dataset as
````{r}  
#write_csv(select(wsj1,-"new_id"),"measles_nonduplicated.csv")
````
### 1.2 Correcting incorrect longitudes <a class="anchor"  id="section_1_2"></a>  
Looking at the data on Tableau revealed another problem with the data. 86 of the records, 3 from Florida and 83 from Vermont, had incorrect longitudes,   
![Some schools were getting mapped outside US](C:/Users/palla/Desktop/GoogleDataAnalyticsCapstoneProject/VaccinationRatesInUSSchools/IncorrectLongitudeInMeaslesDataset.gif)  
Upon checking with google maps, it was clear that in some cases the longitudes were marked as +ve where should have been -ve,  
````{r}
# tmp=wsj1[wsj1$lng>0,]
# tmp[!is.na(tmp$name),]
# rm(tmp)
````
and this problem persisted in the source files where the latitudes and longitudes were taken from.
````{r}
# clean_states[clean_states$lng>0,]
````
However, in most cases, it looked like the lattitudes were incorrectly entered as longitudes.
Since it was not possible to correct each and every case manually, it was decided that
for these 86 cases, the incorrect longitudes would be replaced with generated longitudes
usually assigned to the respective state by Tableau.
Tableau assigns -72.7678 to Vermont and -81.55 to Florida.
````{r}
# wsj1$lng[(wsj1$state=="Vermont" & wsj1$lng>0)]= -72.7678
# wsj1$lng[(wsj1$state=="Florida" & wsj1$lng>80)]= -1* wsj1$lng[(wsj1$state=="Florida" & wsj1$lng>0)]
# wsj1$lng[(wsj1$state=="Florida" & wsj1$lng>0)]= -81.55
# 
# write_csv(select(wsj1,-"new_id"),"measles_nonduplicated_ModifiedIncorrectLng.csv")
